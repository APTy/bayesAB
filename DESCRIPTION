Title: AB Testing for Counts and Proportions using Bayesian Methods
Version: 0.5
Date: 2016-09-01
Authors@R: "Frank Portman <frank1214@gmail.com> [aut, cre]"
Description: bayesAB provides a suite of functions that allow the user to
    analyze AB test data in a similar light to common frequentist hypothesis tests
    (t-test, proportion test, etc.). bayesAB contains functions for choosing an
    informative prior and will allow you to directly state the probability P(A > B)
    for counts and proportions. This has several implications, namely in terms of
    interpretability. Frequentist t-tests that rely on p-values are notoriously hard
    to interpret for statisticians and non-statisticians alike.
