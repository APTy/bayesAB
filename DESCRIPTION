Description: bayesAB provides a suite of functions that allow the user to analyze AB test data in a similar light to common frequentist hypothesis tests (t-test, proportion test, etc.). bayesAB contains functions for choosing an informative prior and will allow you to directly state the probability P(A > B) for counts and proportions. This has several implications, namely in terms of interpretability. Frequentist t-tests that rely on p-values are notoriously hard to interpret for statisticians and non-statisticians alike.
